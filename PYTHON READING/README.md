# Python Reading 
## Chapter 1 The Way of the Program
- I Knew: We've been using interactive mode in class, and it's probably better for learning since you can test as you go.
- I Didn't know: There are high-level and low-level languages. And that low-level languages are easier for computers to run, but high-level languages are easier for humans to read and write. High level also take longer to get processed.

## Chapter 3 Functions
- I Knew: There are built-in functions in the language, and others that need to be defined before using. Functions help debugging and organizing the code easier.
- I Didn't Know: There’s a module object called `math` that you have to import before using it. Like entering a subcategory to limit what functions are available for the code to be interpreted

## Chapter 5 Conditionals and Recursion
- I Knew: Boolean expressions compare operands and evaluate to `True` or `False`. Conditional execution allows different  paths based on the outcomes of the boolean.
- I Didn't know: Indentation can actually cause syntax errors and it’s not just for visual organization. Andtells Python where code blocks begin and end.

## Chapter 10 Lists
- I Knew: You can assign lists to variables and use them to store multiple values in one place.
- I Didn't know: Lists are "mutable", which means I can change their contents (like adding, removing, or modifying items) without having to create a new list.
