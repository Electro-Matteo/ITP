## Problems i faced 

I worked on this project solo, so I created a band where I am all three members.  
While naming band members and roles, I originally had all the text in one paragraph, which made it hard to read. I solved it by putting each role into separate `<p></p>` tags.

The sample website's code was very helpful in understanding the structure of the HTML file. I also saw about the `style.css` file and how it controls the visual design like fonts and colors. I could have used a design template, but I want to build it from scratch so I can learn more how it works.

## Self assessment

I contributed to the project by doing everything myself lol â€” coding website, writing the content

## Group member assessments

Since I worked solo, there were no members to assess :/
