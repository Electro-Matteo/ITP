FizzBuzz 

I wrote a JavaScript code that prints numbers from 1 to 100 with rules:
If a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
If a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

Used a For loop to iterate from 1 to 100
Used if-else conditions to check divisibility.

Printed "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" 
the Problems I Faced 
My friend helped me by showing a reference code, but  ended up switching the integers because theu were not 1 - 100 
The code kept saying "syntax error" when I ran it and I couldn't figure out why. ChatGPT told me I was missing a parenthesis in my if statement.
I added the missing ) in the condition if (count % 3 == 0 && count % 5 == 0).
Also, I used while (running), but I realized that a For loop did the job (chatgbt also told me that)

I tested my code onEloquent JavaScript Website

Friend A provided a reference code that helped me understand the logic.

ChatGPT helped debug the syntax error and recommended switching from while to for.
